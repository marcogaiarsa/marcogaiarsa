- 👋 Hi, I’m @marcogaiarsa
- 👀 I’m interested in logic, mathematics and computer science, this in that order and the rest of the geeky stuff without particular order :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, linux (sysadmin and some bash), while trying my hand at haskell and other functionals.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on snipets and apps for logical and mathematical tasks, as well as system utilities.
- 📫 How to reach me: just email marcoagaiarsa@hotmail.com, old fashioned but I prefer 😬.
